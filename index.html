        <h2>This is me</h2>
        <p>I am a currently a Student Full-Stack Web Developer at Lambda School. I have a 
            beautiful wife for almost 6 years, and two wonderful children! I have always had 
            a nack for taking technology apart and seeing how it worked on the inside. It was
            years later before I found Programming and Web Development. After High School, I 
            enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. I did four years, and then separated after having a 
            family!</p>

        <p>After the military, I did many things professionally. I would contribute my break 
            into Software Engineering from working in Telecommunications. It is was got my start 
            in the IOT's and a co-worker introduced me to HTML and CSS. We would have many conversations 
            throughout the days working about programming and building webpages. After awhile, I found 
            Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp.com, and a few Udemy courses (Thanks Andrei!).</p>
