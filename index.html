        <h2>This is me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I am a currently a Student Full-Stack Web Developer at Lambda School. I have a 
              beautiful wife for almost 6 years, and two wonderful children! I have always had 
              a nack for taking technology apart and seeing how it worked on the inside. It was
              years later before I found Programming and Web Development. After High School, I 
              enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. I did four years, and then separated after having a 
              family!</p>

          <p>After the military, I did many things professionally. I would contribute my break 
              into Software Engineering from working in Telecommunications. It is was got my start 
              in the IOT's and a co-worker introduced me to HTML and CSS. We would have many conversations 
              throughout the days working about programming and building webpages. After awhile, I found 
              Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp.com, and a few Udemy courses (Thanks Andrei!).</p>
